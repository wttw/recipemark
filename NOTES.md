## Other recipe formats

Actual markdown

https://github.com/cnstoll/Grocery-Recipe-Format

Format used by Grocery app; very nice format that
renders fine as Markdown, but also has some structure
Ingredients, with quantities, and timers.

XML hell

https://recipemd.org/specification.html

Another standard format. It uses things like italics to specify quantities, which feels annoying

https://github.com/clarklab/chowdown

Has concept of sub-recipes. Uses frontmatter for
title, images, ingredients and recipe steps. The body
is used solely for a description
